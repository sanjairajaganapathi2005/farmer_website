# Crop Disease Prediction and Crop Recommendation For Farmers

### 1. **Image Upload for Disease Detection**
Allow farmers to upload crop images to detect diseases using machine learning models.

### 2. **Machine Learning Model**
Use CNN (e.g., ResNet or Deep CNN) to classify crop diseases and suggest treatment.

### 3. **Crop Recommendation System**
Suggest suitable crops based on environmental factors like soil type, weather, and location.

### 4. **Educational Resources**
Provide guides on disease prevention, treatment, and crop care best practices.

### 5. **User Profiles and History**
Let users create profiles to track disease predictions and previous recommendations.

### 6. **Weather Integration**
Integrate weather APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) for localized weather forecasts impacting crops.

### 7. **Frontend Development**
Use React.js for a responsive interface.

### 8. **Backend & Hosting**
Use Node.js for backend and flask, deploy on platforms like (Heroku,Render,Vercel), and host ML models on cloud services.
