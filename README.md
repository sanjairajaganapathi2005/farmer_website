# Crop Disease Prediction and Crop Recommendation For Farmers

## Overview

This project aims to assist farmers by providing an innovative solution to detect crop diseases and recommend suitable crops based on environmental factors. It integrates machine learning for disease detection, crop recommendations, educational resources, and weather forecasting.

## Objectives

- **Image Upload for Disease Detection**: Allow farmers to upload crop images, using machine learning models to detect diseases.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Use CNN models like ResNet or Deep CNN to classify crop diseases and recommend treatments.
- **Crop Recommendation System**: Suggest suitable crops based on environmental factors such as soil type, weather, and location.
- **Educational Resources**: Provide guides on disease prevention, treatment, and crop care best practices.
- **User Profiles and History**: Enable users to create profiles and track their disease predictions and previous crop recommendations.
- **Weather Integration**: Integrate weather APIs (such as OpenWeatherMap) to offer localized weather forecasts that impact crops.
- **Frontend Development**: Develop a responsive interface using React.js.
- **Backend & Hosting**: Use Node.js for backend development, Flask for model deployment, and host on platforms such as Heroku, Render, or Vercel, with machine learning models hosted on cloud services.
