# Idea for Crop Disease Prediction and Crop Recommendation System

This system will help farmers manage crop diseases and make informed decisions regarding the selection of crops based on environmental data.

## Key Features:
1. **Disease Detection**: Machine learning models will identify diseases based on uploaded images of crops.
2. **Crop Recommendation**: Recommender system that considers soil type, weather conditions, and other environmental factors.
3. **User Profiles**: Farmers can create profiles to track their previous interactions with the system and access tailored recommendations.
4. **Educational Resources**: Guides and tutorials will educate farmers on disease prevention, treatment methods, and best farming practices.
5. **Weather Integration**: Integration with weather APIs to provide localized forecasts that affect crop growth.

## Challenges:
- Accurate disease detection in varying environmental conditions.
- Ensuring the recommendation engine considers all relevant agricultural factors.
- Building a system that is easy to use for farmers with varying levels of tech literacy.

## Future Enhancements:
- Expand crop disease detection to more crop varieties.
- Improve the recommendation algorithm with more factors like market demand or farming trends.
